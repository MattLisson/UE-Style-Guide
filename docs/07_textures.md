## 7.1 Dimensions Are Powers of 2

All textures, except for UI textures, must have its dimensions in multiples of powers of 2. Textures do not have to be square.

For example, `128x512`, `1024x1024`, `2048x1024`, `1024x2048`, `1x512`.

## 7.2 Texture Density Should Be Uniform

All textures should be of a size appropriate for their standard use case. Appropriate texture density varies from project to project, but all textures within that project should have a consistent density.

For example, if a project's texture density is 8 pixel per 1 unit, a texture that is meant to be applied to a 100x100 unit cube should be 1024x1024, as that is the closest power of 2 that matches the project's texture density.

## 7.3 Textures Should Be No Bigger than 8192

No texture should have a dimension that exceeds 8192 in size, unless you have a very explicit reason to do so. Often, using a texture this big is simply just a waste of resources.

## 7.4 Textures Should Be Grouped Correctly

Every texture has a Texture Group property used for LODing, and this should be set correctly based on its use. For example, all UI textures should belong in the UI texture group.
