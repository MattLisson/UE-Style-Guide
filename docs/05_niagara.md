## 5.1 No Spaces, Ever

As mentioned in [00.1 Forbidden Identifiers][00], spaces and all white space characters are forbidden in identifiers. This is especially true for Niagara systems as it makes working with things significantly harder if not impossible when working with HLSL or other means of scripting within Niagara and trying to reference an identifier.
