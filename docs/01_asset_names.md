# 1. Asset Naming Conventions
[](){ #anc }
[](){ #1 }

Naming conventions should be treated as law. A project that conforms to a naming convention is able to have its assets managed, searched, parsed, and maintained with incredible ease.

Most things are prefixed with prefixes being generally an acronym of the asset type separated by an underscore from the base asset name.

## 1.1 Base Asset Names

All assets should have a _Base Asset Name_. A Base Asset Name represents a logical grouping of related assets. Any asset that is part of this logical group should follow the standard of  `Prefix_BaseAssetName_Variant_Suffix`.

Keeping the pattern `Prefix_BaseAssetName_Variant_Suffix` in mind and using common sense is generally enough to warrant good asset names. Here are some detailed rules regarding each element.

`Prefix` and `Suffix` are to be determined by the asset type through the following [Asset Name Modifier][asset-name-modifiers] tables.

`BaseAssetName` should be determined by a short and easily recognizable name related to the context of this group of assets. For example, if you had a character named Bob, all of Bob's assets would have the `BaseAssetName` of `Bob`.

For unique and specific variations of assets, `Variant` is either a short and easily recognizable name that represents logical grouping of assets that are a subset of an asset's base name. For example, if Bob had multiple skins these skins should still use `Bob` as the `BaseAssetName` but include a recognizable `Variant`. An 'Evil' skin would be referred to as `Bob_Evil` and a 'Retro' skin would be referred to as `Bob_Retro`.

For unique but generic variations of assets, `Variant` is a two digit number starting at `01`. For example, if you have an environment artist generating nondescript rocks, they would be named `Rock_01`, `Rock_02`, `Rock_03`, etc. Except for rare exceptions, you should never require a three digit variant number. If you have more than 100 assets, you should consider organizing them with different base names or using multiple variant names.

Depending on how your asset variants are made, you can chain together variant names. For example, if you are creating flooring assets for an Arch Viz project you should use the base name `Flooring` with chained variants such as `Flooring_Marble_01`, `Flooring_Maple_01`, `Flooring_Tile_Squares_01`.

### 1.2.6.1 Texture Packing
It is common practice to pack multiple layers of texture data into one texture. An example of this is packing Emissive, Roughness, Ambient Occlusion together as the Red, Green, and Blue channels of a texture respectively. To determine the suffix, simply stack the given suffix letters from above together, e.g. `_ERO`.

> It is generally acceptable to include an Alpha/Opacity layer in your Diffuse/Albedo's alpha channel and as this is common practice, adding `A` to the `_D` suffix is optional.

Packing 4 channels of data into a texture (RGBA) is not recommended except for an Alpha/Opacity mask in the Diffuse/Albedo's alpha channel as a texture with an alpha channel incurs more overhead than one without.
